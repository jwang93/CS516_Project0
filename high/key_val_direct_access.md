**MySQL**  
*C4*  
What:
- one of the most popular open source RDBMS currently developed by Oracle
- it is used heavily for web development as it is a critical component of the LAMP stack

Strengths:
- learning curve is pretty low compared to Postgres
- getting Postgres configured, creating a user, etc, was a bit of pain
- free to use 
- can run on Linux, which is a draw because that is the operating system of choice for many web servers 

Weaknesses:
- not as mature as other open sourced databases such as PostgreSQL
- development is not community driven but rather driven by Oracle 
- this can actually be a strength though, it depends on whether you value a slower more robust enterprise development
- from a performance standpoint, I've seen people citing that Postgres benchmarks a little better than MySQL but the difference is marginal
