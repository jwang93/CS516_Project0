**AWS RDS**   
*D5*  
What:
- Amazon's version of a traditional relational database in the cloud 
- you can compare it to a self hosted MySQL 

Strengths:  
- comes with all the Amazon managed goodies (backups, patch management, and replication)
- have this feature called multi AZ which stands for multi availability, which handles replication and backups for failure 
- it also gives a very good up time ~99.95% 

Weaknesses:  
- couple drawbacks to RDS when you are doing complex operations that require many privileges 
- doesn't have very high security needs
