**Hortonworks**  
*A5*  
What:
- a company that builds a variety of solutions for Hadoop 
- they are main competitors with Cloudera and MapR; the emergence of these enterprise Big Data companies 
- they perform a lot of open source development for Hadoop 
- all of these Hadoop distribution providers make their money by selling a suite of services on top of their software 

Strengths:
- Hortonworks and Cloudera provide nearly 100% open source distributions of Hadoop, something their competitor MapR does not do (they have more proprietary modules)
- these are the guys who came out with YARN which is a new version of Hadoop better than the previous MapReduce; YARN allows the inclusion of more data processing frameworks 

Weaknesses:
- because Hortonworks' distribution is completely open source, it is not as enterprise ready as something like MapR's distribution 
- they don't have the reach of Cloudera, who has been around the longest and has the most number of customers
- this does give Cloudera a bit of an edge in terms of knowing what features are needed
