###Structure
1) For this assignment, I decided to divide the systems into two tiers - high priority and low priority. Because I only had so much time, I figured it would be a better usage of time to spend more time focusing on the higher priority systems since they are more likely to be chosen for the final project. 

My criteria for classifying a system as either **high** or **low** was:
- how widely used the system is in industry
- how much documentation there was on the system
- how widely referenced the system is
- how frequently is the systems compared to by similar systems 
- how active is the community for the system 

2) Next, within each tier, I split the systems into eighteen categories - one for type defined in the **Data Platforms Map**. Each category has its own markdown (.md) file. 

The categories are:
- General purpose (*general_purpose.md*)
- Specialist analytic (*specialist_analytic.md*)
- -as-a-service (*as_a_service.md*)
- BigTables (*big_tables.md*)
- Graph (*graph.md*)
- Document (*document.md*)
- Key value stores (*key_val_stores.md*)
- Key value direct access (*ket_val_direct_access.md*)
- Hadoop (*hadoop.md*)
- MySQL ecosystem (*mysql_eco.md*)
- Advanced clustering / sharding (*advanced_clustering_sharding.md*)
- New SQL databases (*new_sql_db.md*)
- Data caching (*data_caching.md*)
- Data grid (*data_grid.md*)
- Search (*search.md*)
- Appliances (*appliances.md*)
- In-memory (*in_memory.md*)
- Stream processing (*stream_processing.md*)
